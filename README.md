# Classification and Detection of Cardiac Disorders using ECG Signal

Cardiovascular diseases remain one of the leading causes of death globally. Accurate and early detection of cardiac abnormalities is crucial for timely medical intervention. Traditional diagnosis using ECG signals can be time-consuming and may depend on expert interpretation.

In this project, we developed a machine learning and deep learning-based system to classify and detect cardiac disorders using ECG signal data. The system aims to assist healthcare professionals by providing an automated and reliable tool for early diagnosis.

We used a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of 1,200 ECG records with 54 pre-processed features. The dataset includes multiple cardiac conditions such as arrhythmia, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and normal sinus rhythms.


## Our methodology involved:

Data Collection & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalization, feature extraction

ML Algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes

Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for higher-level pattern recognition

Accuracy Achieved:

SVM: 92.6%

Random Forest: 97.6%

Naive Bayes: 86.6%

CNN: 99.58% (highest)


Evaluation Metrics
   - Accuracy
   - Sensitivity
   - Specificity
   - F1-Score


Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Keras / TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

The deep learning model (CNN) also visualized training and validation accuracy/loss and performed multi-class classification with robust prediction capability.

This project highlights how integrating AI techniques into medical diagnostics can enhance speed, accuracy, and scalability in identifying life-threatening heart conditions.
